# OLEDify
A possible project for spotify playback display and control based on the ESP8266

The idea for this project came about because OLED screens are tiny, utilize almost negligible amounts of power, and are just really 
cool to mess around with. This one uses an ESP8266 for processing and retrieving the data from the Spotify API over a Wi-Fi network, 
and subsequently displaying it on two SSD1306 128x64 0.96" OLED screens. May possibly also be ported to an SSD1680 E-Paper Display. 
Possible additions include control inputs from a joystick (Skip, Previous, Seeking, Volume +/-, and Play/Pause)
